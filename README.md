### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Sam, I'm fullstack developer, getting happily stuck into the world of software development.

I used to be a journalist with an interest in tech till I took the leap and decided to make a living out of coding instead.

I love learning new technologies and am on the cusp of 3 years in the industry!
