### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Sam, a training junior fullstack developer, getting happily stuck into the world of software development.

I used to be a journalist with an interest in tech till I took the leap this year in September and decided to make a living out of coding instead.

I love learning new technologies and have just finished my JavaScript bootcamp at NorthCoders!

As a result many of the repos under this profile were learning exercises but my big ones of note so far include:

- nc-news: The RESTful news API I've built for my demo news app in a similar style to a Reddit-like forum Utilising PSQL.
- Practice-News: Demo app for the front-end of the api I've built with REACT.
- NC-Giggle: The final project I'm working on with my group, that matches users based on their interests in chatrooms and suggests gigs in their area, to visit as a group. It makes use of Firebase for the chat applications as well as for the user database and authentication and is REACT Native based on the front-end.

All 3 are the best display of my skills so far but will undergo some polish and expansion in the weeks following the course. (Looking forward to the time to do so!)

My primary tech stack is: JavaScript, Node.js, React, Jest, Express, and SQL.
But... during NC-Giggle I utilised Firebase as well for the first time, very exciting.

I am currently working on some projects, in particular a MERN stack project building a social network proof of concept to get used to the application of Mongo DB and some basic apps to revisit some skills covered on my course.

UPDATE: Secured my first job in tech writing software for a company that supplies and maintains electric vehicle charge points, so hopefully I can continue learning on the jobs and increase the complexoities of these projects.
