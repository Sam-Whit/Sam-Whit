### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Sam, I'm fullstack developer, getting happily stuck into the world of software development.

I used to be a journalist with an interest in tech till I took the leap and decided to make a living out of coding instead.

I love learning new technologies and am on the cusp of 3 years in the industry!

Currently I am studying for my AWS Solutions Architect level 2 Exam as well as my HashiCorp Certified: Terraform Associate exam in preparation for some upcoming work at my company. I have ambitions to be a fully full stack engineer with a strong specialism in System Design. Watch this space as I will be uploading projects that help me learn and experiment with code that utilises serverless architecture.
